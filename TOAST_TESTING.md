# Toast Notification Testing

## Overview
The toast notifications have been updated to display as a modal at the bottom left of the page with enhanced styling and functionality.

## Features
- **Modal-style appearance**: Semi-transparent backdrop with enhanced shadows and blur effects
- **Bottom-left positioning**: Fixed position at the bottom left corner of the screen
- **Auto-close functionality**: Automatically closes after 4 seconds (configurable)
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to both light and dark themes
- **Smooth animations**: Slide-in animation from the left

## Testing Methods

### 1. Welcome Toast (First Page Load)
- The first time you visit the page, a welcome toast will automatically appear after 1 second
- This only shows once per browser session (stored in localStorage)
- To reset: Open browser dev tools → Console → Run: `localStorage.removeItem('welcomeToastShown')`

### 2. Test Button
- A "Test Toast" button is positioned in the top-right corner of the page
- Click it to trigger a test toast with the current timestamp
- Hover tooltip shows additional keyboard shortcut information

### 3. Keyboard Shortcut
- Press `Ctrl + T` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + T` (Mac) to trigger a test toast
- The shortcut works from anywhere on the page
- Includes timestamp to verify it's working

### 4. Manual Trigger (For Development)
You can also trigger toasts programmatically by calling:
```javascript
// In browser console or component code
setToastMessage('Your custom message here');
```

## Styling Details
- **Background**: Solid color with blur backdrop filter
- **Border**: Colored border (red accent) matching the current theme
- **Icon**: Alert icon (!) in a circular badge
- **Positioning**: 20px from left and bottom edges
- **Shadows**: Multiple shadow layers for depth
- **Animation**: 0.3s ease-out slide-in from left

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting backdrop-filter
- Graceful degradation for older browsers (no blur effect)
- Responsive across different screen sizes
